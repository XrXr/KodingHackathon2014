To solve world problems, we have to be aware of them first. Conflict mapper is designed to help raising awareness in young people about conflicts that happen aboard. 
We achieve this by aggregating news feeds about world conflicts and displaying this to the user in the form of a heat map. We also provide the user with links to articles that make up our dataset.
